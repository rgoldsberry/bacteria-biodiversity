# bacteria-biodiversity
Data Analysis Bootcamp - Week 12

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to design a web dashboard to help explore a data set (in [samples.json](samples.json)) that lists the types and quantity of bacterias found in subjects' belly buttons. The thinking was that the dashboard can be used by reserachers at the company to identify common bacterias and by subjects in the study to find out if they have a specific bacteria they can sell to the company once the researchers have decided what they want. After building the web page we were asked to deploy it to GitHub Pages so that it will be accessible to anyone with the link.
